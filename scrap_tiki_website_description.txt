Selected groups are will present your weekly project:

- Discuss about how your team achieve the objectives
	=> we separate all elements in 2 parts, use discord to discuss together, share colab notebook to help each other. We use google how to extract <script> tag => found json can help easily.
- Any challenge and how you did solve it
	=> use try except for each element when it sometimes doesn't appear on soup.
	=> extract <script> tag
	=> how to stop the code when we set 1000000 pages to scan when build code to funtions.
	
- Tips/tricks to do this project for other teams
	=> use solution len(products) == 0 to set flag for stopping.
	
- What you learnt from doing the project
	=> in fact is really different with excercise :)
	=> working with partner is faster double time and less stressful :)
	=> set delay_time more higher to get result quality higher, maybe we need set random delay_time in range 25-40
	
- Show the result of your project (pandas dataframe/csv)
